## Description
I wated to create a note or code text editor that I can populate, access, and use with or without an internet connection! I can retrieve the information whether I'm live or not. I wanted to be able to install the application and use it regardless of internet connection, and also knowing my notes and code will be there waiting for me when I exit and come back.

## Usage
Simply open the site, and click inside the box and begin typing your code or notes! Once you're done, you can simply exit the site. If you want to access the notes again, just go back to the site using the same browser and your info is saved! You can also install the app by pressing on the install button. Now, if you're using chrome for example, you can access the app by visiting chrome://apps , and you'll find JATE waiting for you! You can use the app online or offline, and it will save your text just the same.
